# LunchAgent
Simple .NET Console Application for posting menus from menicka.cz to Slack

Application can be run by using `RunScript.bat` script in `/BatchFiles` folder.  
Periodic posting is achieved by creating a .txt file after first run *(not a thing that i'm proud of)*.

Application is using [menicka.cz](https://www.menicka.cz) website for getting data.
